== Introduction

[.subhead]
=== Device Description

image:device.png[] 


The AS76 with PBS device is a part of the product portfolio by SigTuple for clinical laboratories.
It is a computer and imaging-based device that has the capability to scan peripheral blood smears,
locate cells or objects found on the smear, and store, retrieve, view and review digitized images of peripheral blood smears.

The system has a slide tray that allows loading and scanning of standard glass slides. The system features detection of monolayer, automated 1D and 2D barcode reading, scanning at multiple z-levels to produce high-resolution images.
The AS76 with PBS has a bundled reporting application which allows the examination of the high-resolution images produced by the scanner and assists a qualified reviewer in conducting a WBC differential, RBC morphology evaluation and, platelet estimation and morphology evaluation using those images.

The AS76 with PBS device is an automated cell-locating device intended for
Quantitative analysis of WBC (Differential count of white blood cell types)
Semi-quantitative analysis of RBC (Morphological analysis of red blood cells)
Quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of platelets (platelet morphology).

[.subhead]
=== Intended Use 
The AS76 with PBS device is intended to locate and display images of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets acquired from peripheral blood smears and assists a qualified reviewer in conducting a WBC differential count, RBC morphology evaluation and platelet estimation and morphology evaluation using those images. It is meant for in vitro diagnostic use by a qualified professional only.

[.subhead]
=== Principles of operation
From a venous blood sample collected in K~2~EDTA or K~3~EDTA tube, typically flagged by a cell-counter indicating an abnormal morphology, a thin blood film is wedged on a glass slide (a blood smear). The blood smear is then stained with Romanowsky stain. The system uses stained microscope slides made either manually or by an automatic slide smearer and stainer. 

On the AS76 system: 

* The operator places up to 6 slides on the slide tray provided with the system.

* The operator places the slide tray into the system.

* The operator manually enters the Slide ID for the sample (if the slide is not barcoded) or confirms the decoded Slide ID for the sample (if the slide is barcoded). 

* The system moves the slide tray under the optics column, identifies the monolayer on the slide and images a ~30 sq mm area from the detected center of the monolayer.

* The system stitches the individual images captured across the scanned area into a single pyramidal image object.

* The system locates and classifies at least 200 WBCs in the scanned area.

* The system identifies the optimal area (~1 sq mm) to perform morphology analysis of RBCs and estimate the Platelet count.

* The system locates and pre-characterizes the RBC morphologies within the optimal area.

* The system identifies 10 distinct circular areas, each equivalent to a 100X FOV of optical number 22, within this optimal area. The system locates platelets and estimates counts from these circular areas.

* The system uses the above information to prepare the report for WBC morphologies, RBC morphologies, platelet morphologies and platelet count. The system presents the report to trained users (qualified reviewers) on the reporting application.

* The trained users review the system prepared report on the reporting application, make changes where necessary and approve the report for disbursal.

[.subhead]
=== AS76 Reporting

[.subhead2]
==== Sample review and reporting

. The WBC report shall be prepared as follows -
. The investigator shall open the WBC tab of the system generated report.
. The investigator shall review the cell images presented against each WBC morphology and reclassify the cell images if deemed necessary.
. The system shall automatically compute the WBC DC once the investigator has completed reviewing all cell images and performing the necessary re-classifications.
. The RBC report shall be prepared as follows -
. The investigator shall open the RBC tab and then the RBC size sub-tab of the system generated report.
. The investigator shall review the cell images presented against each RBC size morphology (Microcyte, Macrocyte) and the RBC evaluation area in the stitched image. The investigator shall confirm the system-generated grade for each RBC size morphology or change it if necessary. Please note that Anisocytosis is a computed measurand. The computation is described in <<appendix1,Appendix 1>>.
. The investigator shall then move to the RBC shape sub-tab of the system generated report.
. The investigator shall review the cell images presented against each RBC shape morphology and the RBC evaluation area in the stitched image. The investigator shall confirm the system-generated grade for each RBC shape morphology or change it if necessary. Please note that poikilocytosis is a computed measurand. The computation is described in <<appendix1,Appendix 1>>.
. The investigator shall then move to the RBC color sub-tab of the system generated report.
. The investigator shall review the cell images presented against each RBC color morphology (Hypochromic RBCs, Polychromic RBCs) and the RBC evaluation area in the stitched image. The investigator shall confirm the system-generated grade for each RBC color morphology or change it if necessary.
. The platelet report shall be prepared as follows -
. The investigator shall move to the Platelet tab and open the count sub-tab of the system generated report.
. The investigator shall review each of the 10 100X FOVs that are presented by the system. The investigator can confirm the number of platelets located by the system for each FOV or make changes if necessary. The system automatically computes the Platelet count per cu. mm.
. The investigator shall then move to the morphology sub-tab of the system generated report.
. The user reviews the system's cell images for each Platelet morphologies (Large platelets and Platelet Clumps). The user shall also review the stitched image to confirm the presence of absence of the above-mentioned Platelet morphologies. The user can confirm the system generated grade for each of the platelet morphologies or manually change the grade the Platelet morphologies as 'Detected' or 'Not Detected'.

[.subhead]
=== Sources of Variation and impact

. The sources of variation for a laboratory measurement may be divided into preanalytical, analytical, biological-physiological, and pathological. One or a combination of these variables may interfere with the results of either method.
. During the study if such variations cause ambiguous or incoherent results, the impacted data points may be identified as outliers and may be removed from the data analysis with proper justification. However, the discrepant results will also be listed out individually in the datasheet. 
. Due to the ambiguous (and subjective) nature of reporting RBCs through manual microscopy, single bucket grade variations may not be considered as variations.
. For samples in which the AS76 system has picked up cells missed by the investigator during light microscopy review, the investigator shall be asked to review the slides again under a light microscope and confirm their manual microscopy results. This would be done since the investigators have reviewed and confirmed the cells on the AS76 system but have not reported it in the light microscopy report. In such cases, AS76 system is deemed to have superseded the reference method (light microscopy).

[.head]

== Data Management

[.subhead]
=== Light Microscope Reports

The reports filled in by the investigators shall be scanned and stored in a digital form on a regular basis. The digitalized reports shall be shared with the Principal Investigator at the site, attached to the clinical study reports and maintained in the QMS system of the Sponsor.

[.subhead]
=== AS76 Reports

The investigators shall prepare the reports on the AS76 system. The system generated report and the investigator prepared report shall be stored on the system. The system has a report download utility that provides the report information in a file. This file shall be generated daily and stored by the Sponsor. The consolidated files shall be shared with the Principal Investigator at the site, attached to the clinical study reports and maintained in the QMS system of the Sponsor.

[.subhead]
==	Early study termination
The Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate the study for any reason at any time. The Investigator is responsible for promptly informing every IRB and IEC and providing the reason(s) for the suspension or termination of the study (if any). If the study is prematurely terminated, all study data must be returned to the Sponsor. In addition, the site must conduct the final disposition of all unused study devices in accordance with the Sponsor procedures for the study. Upon termination or completion of the study, the following activities, when applicable, must be conducted by the Study Monitor in conjunction with the Investigator, as appropriate:

. Return of all study data to the Sponsor
. Return of all instruments to the Sponsor
. Data clarifications and resolutions
. Accounting, reconciliation, and final disposition of used and unused devices, controls, and standards
. Review of site study records for completeness

==	Informed Consent
This study does not directly recruit patients or participants. The study shall include only residual blood samples that are collected as part of routine work at the laboratory.
For all residual blood samples used for slide preparation as part of the study, either Informed Consent forms or an overall IRB/EC Informed Consent Waiver form shall be submitted. These shall account for all the samples and contributing data points in the study. 

[.head]
==	Adverse device events 
The study is considered a very LOW risk study involving only residual patient samples. 
The Sponsor must immediately conduct an evaluation of all low-risk events and must report the results of the evaluation to the reviewing IRBs, concerned regulatory bodies, and participating investigators after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect.

The following are the Low-risk events which may occur: 

. Electric shock
. Device breakdown
. Issues with scanning and results reported by the device
. Slide breakage

[.head]
==	Monitoring Plan
The study shall be monitored for the following aspects once a week. The frequency may be increased during the study, if necessary.

[.subhead]
===	Device Health 
. The system qualification shall be performed at specified intervals and recorded.
. Each instance of system downtime shall be recorded and analyzed.
. Each instance of slide breakage inside the system shall be recorded and analyzed.
. The study shall be immediately paused for analysis, if any adverse event is encountered.

=== Data integrity 
. The review reports, from light microscopy, of the investigators shall be compared regularly. If the readings between the two investigators are consistently different, the reason for the differences shall be studied before more samples are processed.
. The data traceability for each data point in the study shall be checked periodically.

[.head]
== Accountability

[.subhead]
=== Site Laboratory

. The laboratory shall collect and provide the required slides for the study.
. The laboratory shall provide a safe area for the Sponsor to store the slides during the study.
. The laboratory shall provide the Hematology Analyzer reports, for each of the slides included in the study, to the Sponsor.

[.subhead]
=== Investigators

. The investigators shall review the slides in each method as per the protocol's review guidelines.
. The investigators shall record the review results of each slide in the data sheet and sign it.
. The investigators shall review the study results and present any adverse findings to the sponsor.

[.subhead]
=== Sponsor
